# TeachMate

This platform's purpose:

- to gain a comprehensive view of student progress at class and in school via descriptive charts
- to streamline a teacher's workflow and say goodbye to logistical challenges with on-the-go scheduling

## Origin Story

The inspiration for building TeachMate came from a personal experience.

- My mom conducts tuition classes in math for children from the 6th to 8th grade.

- She used to spend a significant amount of time at the beginning of the week, every Sunday evening, creating schedules for her students and sometimes in the middle of the week too, when kids would cancel or would want to reschedule.

- Moreover, she used to track the students' performance on paper and it would not provide the best experience when trying to measure long term growth.

- So, I built TeachMate to streamline scheduling, improving transparency with parents and students about class timings, and track long-term progress via graphical charts.

- The parents can see their child's growth over time and the students can see their personalised schedule.

- TeachMate is now used by her and 8 of her students.
